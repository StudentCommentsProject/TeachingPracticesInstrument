( In my case , there was problem after problem setting up localhost and the databases on my laptop , and there were so many times I had to rely on others ' work and panicked that I would fail this module 's CA ) We were so lost when it came to learning all those new things at once . It would have been better if the OOSD practical slots were used to actually teach us how to use PHP , MySQL type technology in the perspective of web development , instead of having outsiders come and do those loosely structured workshops which were from a general perspective . I feel like it would have been so helpful to learn them with some structure , rather than us haphazardly googling and putting together pieces of code to make the project . Another thing - Not only me but most of the others agree - the Zoom evaluations for the project were the worst thing we 've been through in the semester . They stressed us all out so much . I believe the reps sent feedback asking not to evaluate the project during the online period , but they were done anyway . I do n't know , maybe I have mental problems , but that project has been the single most stressful thing in my university life . And this was during the corona vacation . I ca n't imagine how much worse it would have been if the regular semester had been going on . I 'm sorry for getting so upset on here . I understand that you are trying to do the best , and , of course software dev can not be taught without a project like this . I just want to say , please try to make it easier for the next batches .

We understood this subject only at the last week of the semester . But when we get the big picture , we were late ! For the project , we could not apply things we learned during last 2 weeks , so how can it measure our true learning ? It was a so tight schedule ! ! ! At the end of the semester , all the lecturers are only concentrating on covering the slides and to finish getting the continuous assessment marks of ours . We came to CSE with the trust you made in us through the first semester well-structured lecture series . But now we see this as a race ; not a true teaching-learning process . Honor Code pledges were taken at the beginning to make sure that we learn everything by our own self . We thought we came to heaven like department where the lecturers help us to grow and we thought we are gon na be one big family . But now we know it is just marketing . We love learning these subjects ; the truth is these are not hard for us . But please give students some time to go to the depth and do things with a better-understanding ! Covering the module and doing the CA evaluations can be done after students learn the subject properly . If our department continues this way for future , you would one day make a stack-overflow generation ; not a skilled and creative workforce ! My request is to give students the freedom to learn concepts and do things creatively , then they will master in the subject . Is n't it the ultimate purpose of both parties ? ? Please give us support to learn things properly first , we really want to learn , we have that passion for the subject ! Please make that environment at CSE ! ! ! Thank you very much madam for everything you taught us throughout the semester ! We know you did a great job for us , although the module was so lengthy for this semester ! ! Hope our feedback would help the administration to make a better CSE Dept tomorrow !",
